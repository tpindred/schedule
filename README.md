# schedule
A tool to scrape instructor schedules and provide notification of changes

This was used during the 2016/17 season to pull schedule info from the WP RTP web server and send update emails
when changes were made. I was able to get the program functioning locally for my profile before I left for the season.

The plan for this season was to allow other instructors to use the tool, but unfortunately the scheduling system
was abandoned for another product this season.
